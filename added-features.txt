** scrolling on the canvas is too aggressive \

** would like to be able to set the link lengths by also typing the lengths (in addition to using the slide bars) \

- try to make the input boxes more compact, ideally there won't be a need to scroll down on the page. Perhaps make the boxes collapsible if everything cannot fit in one window \

** 'Length' and 'Input by coordinates' radio buttons don't seem to do anything. \

** when reset button is pressed, the mechanism should go back to the starting point, however the mechanism should remain. You can add another button 'reset all' that will reset the entire program \

** we should have coordinates for point P (coupler point) \

** point P should be labeled on the screen \

** make the XY axes a different color so it is not confused with the linkage, maybe a light gray

** grid doesn't update when zooming out
